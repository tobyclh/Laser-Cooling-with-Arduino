# Laser-Cooling-with-Arduino

This project is started as a part of a university course,
which ultilize Arduino and Labview to monitor the temperature of the environment,
while experiment will be conducted to see how far we can go with laser cooling.

The temperature sensing uses LM35

(Need construction)
